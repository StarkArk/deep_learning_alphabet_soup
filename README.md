# deep_learning_alphabet_soup

## Introduction

The project is to provide the client, Alphabet Soup, with a model to predict the success of companies they provide funding for. They have provided a CSV containing the metadata for each of the over 34,000 organizations they have funded. 
We apply principles of machine learning specifically to a deep-learning model to be used by Alphabet Soup
